        This isn’t a fictional story. This happened to me in 2025 — a year that tested my mind,
        my strength, and my will to continue.  
        What you’re about to read is not about winning — it’s about <strong>not giving up</strong>.
    </div>

    <div class="main-story">

        <p>
            Probably in July (I guess), our school asked us to come for the registration of Semester 3 exams.
            We were told to bring necessary documents such as two passport-size photos in school uniform,
            a phone bill (the West Bengal Government had given ₹10,000 to buy a phone for educational purposes),
            Xerox copies of the Class 11 registration certificate, and Aadhaar card.
        </p>

        <p>
            Different dates were provided for Science, Arts, and Commerce students.
            And here was my first mistake — I didn’t check the dates properly. 😔  
            I wish I had paid more attention that day.
        </p>

        <h2>1. The Morning Breakdown</h2>

        <p>
            I think it was Friday. I usually return home late from math tuition around 9:45 AM,
            and our school starts at 10:40 AM. I had to reach school before the registration began.
            But that day… it felt like something bad was waiting for me.
        </p>

        <p>
            On my way to school, my bicycle chain suddenly fell off.
            This used to happen often, so I didn’t panic.
            I fixed it and continued riding.
            But after some distance, it happened again.
        </p>

        <p>
            Then came the worst part.
            The chain completely broke.
            I was totally f*cked at that moment.
            Panic attacks hit me hard.
            Time was running out, and I was too scared to even look at my watch.
        </p>

        <p>
            While walking with my damaged cycle, I felt something pulling it.
            When I looked down, the chain was stuck with a small but hard pin.
            I underestimated it and used all my strength —
            and damn! The chain and the cycle completely separated.
        </p>

        <p>
            A boy was happily pedaling to school,
            completely clueless that disaster was about to strike.
        </p>

        <p>
            I thought of leaving my cycle and taking a Toto.
            But I had only a ₹200 note.
            Drivers refused because they didn’t want to give change.
            I knew no one would help me.
        </p>

        <p>
            Then I noticed my friend Sanhik Ghosh’s house.
            I went there hoping for help.
            He wasn’t home — but his father was.
        </p>

        <p>
            I explained everything.
            Without hesitation, he gave me his son’s old bicycle
            and even ₹5 to fill air in the tires.
            That moment meant everything to me.
        </p>

        <p>
            Sanhik, if you’re reading this —
            my deepest respect and love to your father and mother
            (especially for feeding me Maggi 😚).
        </p>

        <h2>2. The Registration Panic</h2>

        <p>
            When I finally reached school, I felt relieved.
            But the moment I entered the registration hall,
            it felt like I had entered a zoo.
            Students everywhere — unfamiliar faces, chaos, noise. 😅
        </p>

        <p>
            I asked a few students for help.
            What they told me shattered everything:
            “Tumi G marao. Aj Arts ar Commerce er registration,
            Science er kal hoye geche.”
        </p>

        <p>
            My brain literally stopped working.
            I sat alone on a bench, head down,
            feeling roasted by life itself.
        </p>

        <p>
            Then I heard students talking about phone bills.
            My heart dropped.
            A teacher confirmed —
            without a phone bill, my registration would remain incomplete.
        </p>

        <p>
            I went to the washroom, trying to calm myself.
            I remembered Rancho saying, “All is well.”
            That’s when I called my friend Subarna.
        </p>

        <p>
            He and another friend were planning to arrange a phone bill.
            We searched for a shop, but the shopkeeper refused.
            Once again, hope disappeared.
        </p>

        <p>
            Seeing my condition, Subarna decided to edit a bill himself.
            He used Rajat’s Flipkart receipt and modified it skillfully.
            At that moment, I realized —
            skills really do save lives.
        </p>

        <p>
            Fear returned when someone asked,
            “What if they find out it’s fake?” 😣
            My body froze again.
        </p>

        <p>
            I remembered my Dada — the walking Google.
            I called home for his number.
            The call went to my dad.
            I tried to avoid the truth, but he understood everything.
        </p>

        <p>
            Surprisingly, he didn’t scold me.
            Instead, he arranged an original phone bill through his friend.
            For the first time, I felt relief instead of fear.
            One snap — Thanos style — and my pressure vanished. 🤗
        </p>

        <h2>3. The Race for Change</h2>

        <p>
            We returned to school by Toto.
            Before entering, Subarna asked if I had ₹50 for registration.
            I didn’t.
        </p>

        <p>
            I asked a shopkeeper for change.
            She refused.
            Then an old lady nearby helped me instantly —
            no questions, no judgment.
            Just kindness.
        </p>

        <p>
            I convinced my teacher,
            submitted all documents,
            waited for my uncle,
            and finally handed over the original bill.
            My registration was complete.
        </p>

        <h2>What I Learned</h2>

        <p>
            This day taught me that no matter how bad things get,
            you should never give up.
            Help comes from unexpected places.
            Kind people still exist.
        </p>

        <p>
            And most importantly —
            there is a strength inside me
            that I didn’t even know I had.
            I survived that day.
            I finished it.
            I overcame it.
